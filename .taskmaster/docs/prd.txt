## Key User Flows
1. **Voice Note Creation**: User records voice note → AI transcribes → System creates structured activity → User confirms and saves
2. **Customer Lookup**: User speaks customer name → AI searches database → System displays customer profile and recent interactions
3. **Deal Management**: User navigates to deals → Views pipeline → Updates deal status via voice or interface → System tracks changes
4. **AI Assistant Interaction**: User activates assistant → Speaks query or types → AI provides contextual response → User takes suggested actions

## UI/UX Considerations
- Mobile-first responsive design for field sales usage
- Intuitive voice activation with clear visual feedback
- Minimalist interface to reduce cognitive load
- Fast loading times for on-the-go access
- Accessibility features for diverse user needs
